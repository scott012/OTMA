2. **Email Notifications**:
    - Should there be a way to customize the email content or template?
		a. no need to.

		a. At this time, no.

5. **User Interface**:
    - Do you have any specific requirements or preferences for the user interface design?
		a. It should be easy to read and understand the shifts being offered. Some colour, but not too much.
    - Will there be mobile-specific optimizations for employees accessing the system from mobile devices?
		a. Perhaps in the future. We may design a mobile app to access the system. This should be considered for future-proofing the system.

6. **Auditing and Logging**:
    - Should there be an audit trail of actions performed by admins and employees for security and compliance?
		a. Not automated. Admins should be able to view the reports mentioned earlier to allow them to audit.
