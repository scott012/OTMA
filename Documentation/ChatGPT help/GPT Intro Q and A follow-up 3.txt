### Final Follow-Up Questions

1. **User Management**:
    - How will admin users be authenticated? Is there a higher level of security for admin accounts compared to regular users?
		a. No, admin users will be "super-users". 

2. **Email Notifications**:
    - If no provision is needed now for customizing email content or tracking deliveries, should we at least ensure the system architecture can accommodate these features if future requirements change?
		Let's not worry about this right now.

3. **Shift Management**:
    - For entering employees' "continuous service dates," should this be a one-time setup or periodically updated? Will there be a need for any verification or validation process for these dates?
		a. it will be a one-time step when the user is created by the admin user.

4. **Data Backup and Recovery**:
    - Since you're not sure about the agency's backup frequency, do you want to include a basic backup plan within the application to ensure data safety (e.g., daily backups stored locally)?
		a. not at this time.

5. **User Interface**:
    - Emulating the look and feel of the CBSA website is clear. Are there any specific accessibility requirements or standards (e.g., WCAG) that need to be followed?
		a. it may need to be english & french in the future, but we'll only create it in english right now. No other accessibility requirements exist right now.

6. **Auditing and Logging**:
    - Even though detailed logging isn't required, should there be minimal logging for critical actions like password changes, shift selections, and account creations for accountability?
		a. no.

7. **Future Scalability**:
    - With the potential for future feature requests, should we incorporate a modular design from the start to make adding new features easier?
		a. Yes please!

### Suggestions

1. **Security**:
    - Even if not required now, consider a modular approach for implementing security features like RBAC and encryption so that these can be added with minimal changes if needed in the future.
		a. yes please.

2. **Email Notifications**:
    - Implementing a modular email notification system now can save time and effort if customization or tracking features become necessary later.
		a. yes please.

3. **User Interface**:
    - Since user tech-savviness varies, incorporating user feedback mechanisms in the interface design phase can help tailor the usability to meet the needs of all users.
		a. not at this time.

4. **Logging and Auditing**:
    - Basic logging should include critical actions to help with troubleshooting and ensuring accountability without overwhelming the system with unnecessary logs.
		a. not at this time. maybe in the future.

5. **Scalability**:
    - Planning for modular design and horizontal scaling now will ensure the system can grow and adapt to future demands without requiring significant overhauls.
		a. yes please!

### Implementation Steps

1. **User Authentication**: Implement robust authentication mechanisms for both admin and regular users.
2. **Email Notification System**: Develop a modular system for sending emails, allowing easy future customization and tracking.
3. **User Interface Design**: Create a responsive and accessible design that mirrors the CBSA website, incorporating user feedback for ease of use.
4. **Data Handling**: Ensure data backup and recovery plans are in place, with minimal logging for critical actions.
5. **Future-Proofing**: Design the system architecture to be modular and scalable, accommodating future feature additions and increased load.
